# Dans-Website

Dans-Website is my final project for Flatiron School as well as a personal thank you to my Bass teacher for teaching me over the years. The website is fully depolyable and serves as a marketing platform for my teacher to advertise himself as a private music teacher as well as a professional page for private projects.
